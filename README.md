## Buoys for Consideration
- Pacific, Seattle - Alaska [Link](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/station_page.php?station=46066)
- [DEPRECATED/OMITTED] Atlantic, European Side ? Britain does not keep good accessible records.
- [DEPRECATED/OMITTED] Atlantic, North American Side [Link](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/station_page.php?station=41048)
